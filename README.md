### Introduction

The Indirect Rendering System is a GPU Instancing tool for Unity's Universal Rendering Pipeline that is capable of efficiently rendering a large number of static meshes through Graphics.RenderMeshIndirect API.

The system uses Compute Shaders to sort meshes based on the distance from the camera, calculating the appropriate Level of Detail that should be rendered. 
After that, culling is performed based on camera view frustum and a hierarchical depth buffer, thus excluding occluded or outside of view meshes from rendering.

This package is a reimplementation of Elvar Orn Unnthorsson's technique that was presented here:
